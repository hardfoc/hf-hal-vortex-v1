"""Which hf-core handler and which chip driver each manager uses, from the #include lines.

Reads: Managers on the left, hf-core handlers in the middle, chip drivers on the right. An arrow means "includes and
uses": a manager owns or borrows the handler it points at, and each handler wraps exactly one driver. Several
managers share the TMC9660 handler, because that one chip provides motor control, GPIO, ADC channels and a
temperature sensor; MotorController owns it and the others reach it through MotorController. LedManager uses its
driver directly, without a handler. Managers with no arrow (communication buses, NVS) talk to the interface wrap
only.
